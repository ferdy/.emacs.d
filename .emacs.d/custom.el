;;; custom.el --- Part of my Emacs configuration

;;; Commentary:
;; First file to be loaded when Emacs starts.

;;; Code:
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
