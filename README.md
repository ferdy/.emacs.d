# .emacs.d

This is the Emacs configuration I use everyday.

It targets **Debian-based** and **Ubuntu-based** systems and requires an Emacs
version built from **development sources**.

You can find it useful if you plan to work with:

- Clojure and ClojureScript
- Haskell and Idris
- Rust
- Git
- LaTeX
- Markdown

## Setup
- clone Emacs trunk:
```console
$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
```
- build Emacs trunk:
```console
$ cd emacs
$ sudo apt-get build-dep emacs24
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./autogen.sh git
$ ./configure --host=x86_64-debian-linux-gnu
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ make clean
```
- clone this repo to your home directory:
```console
$ cd
$ git clone git@github.com:manuel-uberti/.emacs.d.git
```
- install the dictionaries for the spell-checker:
```console
$ cd .emacs.d
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/hunspell
$ sudo cp etc/dictionaries/* /usr/share/hunspell
```
- put the kettle on and run ```esetup```:
```console
$ chmod +x esetup
$ ./esetup -y
```
*Note*: you can run `esetup` without the `-y` option to step through the
installation process.

- run Emacs

The first time you run Emacs, every package configured in `init.el` and in every
file in the `lisp` directory will be automatically installed and configured.

## Updates
This configuration tracks latest Emacs developments, so I highly recommend you
update and build your sources at least once a week.

You can use [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit); `magit-status` is bound
to <kbd>C-c vÂ v</kbd>. Or you can do it with the command line:
```console
$ cd emacs
$ git pull
```
Now you can build Emacs:
```console
$ ./configure --host=x86_64-debian-linux-gnu
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ make clean
```
I would also recommend you regularly upgrade every package installed. You can
easily do it with [Paradox](https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/paradox), which is
bound to <kbd>C-c a p</kbd>.

If sources do not build correctly, or you find errors while using the latest
commit, you can still revert to a working commit and re-build:
```console
$ git reset --hard <commit>
$ ./configure --host=x86_64-debian-linux-gnu
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ make clean
```
With the help of tools such as [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit),
[Paradox](https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/paradox) and your preferred shell,
maintenance is simple.
