My Emacs configuration.

An ongoing, probably never-ending, journey through Emacs Lisp looking for the *right* setup for *my* daily usage.

It requires **Emacs trunk** to work.
I regularly update my sources from here: ```git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git```

I use Emacs on **Debian sid**. This configuration requires some external packages to work, all of them highlighted in the comments when necessary.

The **esetup** script helps creating the right environment before starting Emacs with this configuration. If it does not work as you expect, *fix it yourself*.

I mainly use Emacs for **Lisp** (Clojure, Common Lisp, Scheme and Elisp) and **LaTeX**, so my setup is planned accordingly.

This configuration is provided with *no guarantee and no support*.
