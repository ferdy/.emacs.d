##Preface
This is the Emacs configuration I use everyday.

It requires Emacs built from development sources to work. I regularly update my
sources from here:

```console
git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
```

I use Emacs on [LinuxBBQ](http://linuxbbq.org/). The ```esetup``` script helps
to create the right environment *before* starting Emacs with this configuration
for the first time. The script only works with **Debian-based** systems.

This configuration uses
[use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) and relies heavily upon
[Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm). I mainly work with **LaTeX**,
**Clojure** and **Org-mode**.

##Setup
On your **Debian-based** machine:

- clone Emacs trunk:
```console
$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
```
- build Emacs trunk:
```console
$ cd emacs
$ sudo apt-get build-dep emacs24
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ make clean
```
- clone this repo to your home directory:
```console
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/manuel-uberti/.emacs.d
```
- run ```esetup```:
```console
$ cd .emacs.d
$ chmod +x esetup
$ ./esetup
```
- run Emacs

##Updates
This configuration tracks latest Emacs developments. If you intend to use it, I
highly recommend you update and build your sources at least once a week.

You can use [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit); ```magit-status``` is bound
to ```C-c vÂ v```. Or you can do it with the command line:
```console
$ cd emacs
$ git pull
```
Now you can build Emacs:
```console
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ make clean
```
I would also recommend you regularly upgrade every package installed. You can
easily do it with [Paradox](https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/paradox), which is
bound to ```C-c a p```.

If sources do not build correctly, or you find errors while using the latest
commit, you can still revert to a working commit and re-build:
```console
$ git reset --hard <commit>
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ make clean
```
With the help of tools such as [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit),
[Paradox](https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/paradox) and your preferred shell,
maintenance is fairly simple.
